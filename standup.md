Previously: Last time, we created a Markdown page where we write down all of the things that happened during our last meeting, so anyone can look back and get up to speed.

New: Next thing on the agenda is making our page look awesome and spiffy
/*Video or presentation of what needs to be done here*/

Summary:
1.) We have to familiarize ourselves with CSS to add some brand new touches to our page
2.) The things we have to add to our page go as follows:
- Comments
- Color
- Background
- Borders, Margins, Padding
- Text modifications(i.e. color, fonts)
- Sizing
- Positioning
- Grid
- Implement some CSS selectors

Conclusion: Seems simple with only 2 steps, but it has a lot of things that you need to do to finish up these steps. Have fun with the modifications!
